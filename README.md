# my first solo site

Trying to do a solo project and documenting my struggles and victories

1. I set up the initial html, css and js documents connecting them all in the index.html file.

2. To prevent manual reloads I installed Parcel, although the last time I did that was about six months ago as part of the javascript course - guess it's time to review some lectures. Easy enough.

3. To be able to build this website step by step and also track my progress, I remembered that git was what is mostly used today. Luckily the Parcel and Git lectures weren't too far from each other. Git was a bit trickier but thank goodness for the cheat sheet on github.

4. After finally setting everything up, and populating the page with the initial content, I struggled, but eventually managed to complete my first commit.

5. Now comes the fun part: styling. I actually already selected a font previously (which might change) because the default one is terrible. Also, global resets were done before anything else.

Let's start with the nav and hero section.

O, wait. What colors am I going to use? Time to hit shuffle on coolors.co... Well after not too many hits of spacebar I found a pallete that I like (For now? We'll see).

I want to do something cool with the "sub-titles" under my name, let me ponder for a while and come back tomorrow.

So it's been more than a day, I know. But I think I am on to something I believe to be cool. I want to have adapting icons for the subtitles (adapting meaning they change on hover)

6. I've decided to but the icon thing on pause for now. Started with styling the page, changing the font sizes, line spacing etc.
